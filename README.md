## Foundations of AI Course assignments - Group 09
This repo hosts the assignments of the course "Foundations of AI" for group 09.
The assignments are implementing 4 different adversary agents for the "Competitive Sudoku" (described below) game.

### Game description and rules
(The followingg description and rules have been taken as-is from the relative course material file)  
  
Competitive sudoku is an adversarial two-player game, in which players take
turns filling out cells of a given sudoku puzzle. Players score points by completing regions; when the puzzle is completed, the player with the most points
wins. Because the puzzle-aspect of the sudoku is non-trivial, it is in general
non-obvious which value should be entered in which cell. The game is played
under the supervision of an oracle that ensures the puzzle remains solvable after every move. Note that the game may be played with improper puzzles, in
particular, the game may be started with a completely empty grid.
